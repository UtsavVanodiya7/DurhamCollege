# AI Algorithms Project
Project for Introduction to AI Algorithms' subject can be found in AI Algorithms directory.

# How to Run Project
- Download each and everything from Delivery and Acceptance folder.
- Install PyQt5 library (<i>pip install PyQt5</i>).
- We need to pass an input csv file which must contains data in format mentioned below.
    - Stock Name,value1,value2,....,value105
    - (So, we need to pass stock name on first column and than 105 values of stock price, it is between 9:15 to 11:00).
    - To create an input csv from dataset, you can use create_test_csv_file.ipynb file from Modeling & Evaluation folder. 
     You need to pass csv file path of one minute of data there.

In the above images, we can see that we have to path of input csv file and we have to select model then run, output will be appended in to the below area.
